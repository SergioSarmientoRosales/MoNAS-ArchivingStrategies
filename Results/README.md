# Results Description

This directory contains the final results generated after processing and analyzing the experimental data.

The results are organized into aggregated numerical outputs and visual representations, as described below.

## Global

The `Global` folder contains the consolidated results obtained from all experiments.

This folder includes:
- Results combined across all seeds
- Truncated solution sets using different budgets:
  - **K = 15 (75 %)**
  - **K = 10 (50 %)**
  - **K = 5 (25 %)**

Each truncation represents a reduced subset of solutions selected from the global data and is used for comparison and evaluation of different strategies.


## plots_from_cloud

The `plots_from_cloud` folder contains graphical visualizations generated from cloud-based executions.

These plots are used to:
- Visually analyze the results
- Compare different truncation levels
- Support interpretation and reporting of experimental outcomes

The figures typically summarize the behavior of the methods across seeds and truncation budgets.

## Summary

- `Global` stores aggregated and truncated numerical results
- `plots_from_cloud` stores visual outputs
- Together, these folders provide both quantitative and visual insights into the experiments
