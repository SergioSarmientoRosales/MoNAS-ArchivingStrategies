# Seeds Data Description

This directory contains the data generated from multiple experimental runs (*seeds*) using different performance predictors.

The data is organized into **raw results** and **processed results**, as described below.


## RAW

The `RAW` folder contains the original outputs of all seeds for all predictors.

Each CSV file in this folder follows the same structure:

- **Column 1**: Encoded chromosome (integer representation)  
  - Each chromosome is composed of **28 categorical tokens**
  - Tokens are derived from the **BASS search space** (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045675)
- **Column 2**: Predicted PSNR value
- **Column 3**: Number of trainable parameters

No filtering or deduplication is applied at this stage.  
These files represent the complete set of predicted architectures generated by the experiments.

## Processed

The `Processed` folder contains post-processed versions of the raw data.  
The goal of this step is to remove duplicated architectures and keep a reduced set of unique solutions.

It is divided into two main subfolders:


### C-index

This folder contains the processed results based on the **C-index predictor**.

The processing is performed in three steps:

1. **C_predicted**  
   - Contains all predicted architectures from all seeds
   
2. **Duplicates**  
   - Contains architectures that were identified as duplicates
   - These architectures were removed during the filtering process

3. **C_reduced**  
   - Contains the filtered datasets
   - These files are used for further analysis and archiving

### MSE

This folder follows the **same processing pipeline** as `C-index`, but using the **MSE-based predictor** instead.

It includes:
- All predicted architectures
- A deduplication step
- Separate storage of duplicated and reduced architectures


## Summary

- `RAW` contains all original seed outputs
- `Processed` contains cleaned and deduplicated data
- Deduplication is based on the encoded chromosome
- Reduced datasets are used for subsequent Pareto analysis and archiving strategies

This organization ensures traceability from raw predictions to the final reduced datasets.
