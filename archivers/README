# Archivers Module

This directory contains the core implementation of the **offline archiving framework** used in the paper.  
It defines the logic for constructing, filtering, truncating, and analyzing Pareto archives from a globally deduplicated solution cloud.

The module is designed around a **central orchestration component** (`brain.py`) that coordinates multiple archiving strategies and a set of helper utilities that ensure deterministic, reproducible, and structurally consistent archive construction.


## Core Design Philosophy


The module separates:
- **Orchestration logic** (what to apply, when, and how),
- **Archiving strategies** (how solutions are selected or removed),
- **Supporting utilities** (data handling, normalization, plotting, and record management).
