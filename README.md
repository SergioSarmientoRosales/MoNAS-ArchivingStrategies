# MoNAS-ArchivingStrategies
Reproducible framework for offline analysis of Pareto archiving strategies in MoNAS. Includes global solution cloud construction, reference front generation, controlled compression, and structural evaluation of representations. Enables compact Pareto approximations and reduces the number of architectures requiring full retraining.
